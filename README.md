# BSides Boise 2017 Electronic Badge

The concept we had for this years badge was a 'hackable' badge that attendees
could hack on while at the con. We wanted it to be accessible and useful post-con as well.

We chose the Lolin ESP-12 NodeMCU clone using an ESP8266 chipset as the MCU, and
decided to mount it on a 30 pin breadboard with 4 RGB LED's. This would give us the
requisite bling, and give attendees some easy visual feedback for learning how to
control the MCU.

We also chose to use the Arduino IDE for ease of access by attendees.
[here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Programming-ESP8266-ESP-12E-NodeMCU-Using-Arduino-/) is a very useful writeup on how to configure the IDE for the Lolin.
You can also find the steps under docs/building.md

Also included under the docs folder are the datasheets for the LED's and the Lolin NodeMCU clone.

@badgerops also created a Fritzing project for this badge located at docs/fritzing project

We hope you enjoy hacking on this badge, and can't wait to see what people make it do!
